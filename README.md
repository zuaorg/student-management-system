# student-management-system

* Developed a web application for student management using Python, Flask, MySQL Database, and HTML.
* Designed and implemented a MySQL database schema including defining tables, primary keys, unique constraints (student_number, course_number), and considering foreign keys and indexes for optimization.
* Built API endpoints using Python Flask following a structured approach for managing data related to students, courses, and sections (e.g., /students/, /courses/, /sections/).
* Created HTML user interfaces with hyperlinks to display information such as student grades (linking to instructor and course details), student lists, and course prerequisites.
